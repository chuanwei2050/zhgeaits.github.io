>  My name is ZhangGe, and I am the student from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China majoring in Software Engineering. I am from Guangdong. When I was a child at five-grade in primary school, I began to learn a computer language named Q-basic to solve simple math problem, which had amazed me because I have found that I can communicate with a machine by using Q-basic. It would be proud to talk about that I won the third prize when I took part in the computer competition in the city. From then on I have loved computer programming.

And because of this, I didn’t won any prizes in the national computer competition. After that I began learn algorithm and data structure by myself. Until I came to my university, I began to learn computer science knowledge systematically, such as from top down to bottom to know about how to develop a software and from bottom up to top to understand computer mechanism. More important, I learn to communicate and work with my team mates successfully and learn the ability to design a software. Although I am not a computer genius, I love computer technology and love to learn and apply new technology.
